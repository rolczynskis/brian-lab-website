<p class="page-text">In the next phase of optoelectronics, scientists and engineers will actively control processes like
quantum-mechanical phase evolution, stepwise electronic processes, system-environment interactions, and
photoprotective mechanisms, to bolster existing material capabilities and enable entirely new ones.
Our vision is to adopt strategies that have succeeded in biology, such as the precise structural control
of modular chromophore networks and the feedback-based optimization of systems, to produce materials for
applications like photovoltaics, transistors, sensors, communications, and quantum-information technologies.</p>
